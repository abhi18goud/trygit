A detailed Java DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) course typically covers foundational and advanced topics. Below is a breakdown of the topics that may be included:

Foundations of Java Programming
Overview of Java Basics: Syntax, variables, data types, loops, conditionals, etc.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction.

Key Java Features: Exception handling, I/O, and collections framework (ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, etc.).

Basic Data Structures
Arrays

Introduction to arrays, operations (insertion, deletion, traversal).

Multi-dimensional arrays (e.g., matrices) and problems such as searching and sorting.

Strings

String manipulation techniques.

Important algorithms: palindrome check, substring search, character frequency count.

Linked Lists

Singly Linked List: Creation, traversal, insertion, deletion.

Doubly Linked List and Circular Linked List.

Problems: reversing a linked list, detecting loops in a linked list.

Stacks

Stack implementation using arrays and linked lists.

Applications: Expression evaluation, parenthesis matching.

Queues

Queue implementation (array-based, linked-list-based).

Variants: Circular Queue, Priority Queue, and Deque.

Advanced Data Structures
Trees

Binary Trees: Traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order), height, and depth calculation.

Binary Search Trees (BST): Insert, search, and delete operations.

Advanced trees: AVL, Red-Black Tree, Segment Tree.

Graphs

Graph Representation: Adjacency matrix and adjacency list.

Algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra's algorithm, Floyd-Warshall, and Kruskal's/MST.

Applications: shortest path, connected components, cycle detection.

Heaps

Min-Heap and Max-Heap implementation.

Heap sort and priority queue applications.

Hashing

Hashing techniques (linear probing, chaining).

Applications: Anagrams, counting frequencies efficiently.

Algorithms
Sorting Algorithms

Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort.

Merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, and counting sort.

Searching Algorithms

Linear search and binary search.

Applications of binary search in rotated arrays.

Divide and Conquer

Merge sort, quick sort, and other applications.

Dynamic Programming (DP)

Common problems: Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem, longest common subsequence (LCS), matrix chain multiplication.

Greedy Algorithms

Problems: Activity selection, Huffman encoding, minimum spanning trees (Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms).

Backtracking

Problems: N-Queens, maze solving, subset generation.

Recursion

Fundamental concepts: recursion tree, depth-first problem-solving.

Applications: Tower of Hanoi, permutations and combinations.

Complexity Analysis
Space and Time Complexity.

Big-O, Big-Theta, and Big-Omega notation.

Analyzing algorithms for performance.

Practical Problem-Solving
Coding Platform Problems

Practice problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces.

Focus on solving problems from easy to hard levels.

Competitive Programming Topics

Bit manipulation, modular arithmetic, combinatorics, advanced graph theory.

Applications in Real World
Implementing data structures in real-world scenarios (e.g., caching mechanisms, game development, etc.).

Algorithms for common tasks: pattern matching, data compression.
